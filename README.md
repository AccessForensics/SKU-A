SKU-A is a high-fidelity digital forensics engine designed to produce tamper-evident **Verification Packets** for legal defense.

### Core Evidentiary Components
* **01_Report:** The `Execution_Report.txt` and `interaction_log.json` timeline.
* **02_Exhibits:** Synchronized triplets of PNG (Visual), AX-Tree (Structural), and HTML (Source).
* **03_Verification:** The `journal.ndjson` flight recorder and `packet_hash.txt` seal.

### Forensic Doctrine
This system explicitly rejects evaluative language. All captures are recorded via mechanical verbs: OBSERVED, RECORDED, ATTEMPTED.
